# Dryas-2.0
 R code for dryas work
 
 Spectal data and metadata can be aqcuired in the FM_Polar_Studies shared drive - These data will be finding a new home soon.
 
 The following scripts were the main workhorses for my analyses: 
 01_clean_up.r - code for cleaning the spectral data
 caret_plsda.r - PLSDA script
 distances.r - comparison of phylogenetic distance to spectral distance
 traits.r - morphological trait analyses
 DA_PLSR.r - PLSR for predicting ancestry from spectra
